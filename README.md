# SipSwipe

This is a Next.js implementation of the SipSwipe beer dating app landing page, featuring a modern design with React components and CSS Modules.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd SipSwipe`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## File Structure
- `src/app/`: Contains the root layout and homepage.
- `src/components/`: React components for each section.
- `src/styles/`: CSS Modules for component-specific styles.
- `public/`: Placeholder for static assets (e.g., images).
- `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Notes
- The design is responsive and SEO-optimized with metadata.
- Integrations (e.g., Untappd) use placeholder text—replace with actual logos.
- Form submissions are simulated; integrate with a backend for real functionality.
